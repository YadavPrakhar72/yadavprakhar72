# Hi there, I'm Prakhar Yadav 👋

## Data Analyst with a unique blend of analytical rigor and a multi-disciplinary perspective.

I'm passionate about translating complex datasets into actionable insights. My journey into data began with a strong quantitative foundation from **IIT Roorkee** and was further shaped by five years of intensive preparation for the UPSC Civil Services Examination. This experience honed my ability to synthesize vast amounts of information and instilled in me immense resilience and discipline.

Today, I leverage this unique background to solve complex problems and drive value in data-driven organizations.

- 🔭 I’m currently expanding my portfolio with more end-to-end Machine Learning projects.
- 🌱 I’m always learning about new data visualization techniques and cloud data platforms.
